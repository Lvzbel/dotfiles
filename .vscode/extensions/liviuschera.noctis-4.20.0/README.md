Noctis is a colection of light & dark themes with a well balanced blend of warm and cold _medium contrast_ colors.

The theme is designed to:

-  be easy on the eyes thus reducing the eye strain
-  give semantic meaning to theme's colors

Noctis comes in six versions. Five are dark and one is light.

The background of **Noctis**, **Noctis Sereno** & **Noctis Obscuro** is a very saturated very dark cold bluish cyan, **Noctis Azureus'** is a very saturated very dark cold azure and **Noctis Uva's** is a unsaturated dark cold blue.<br>Blue is a cool calming color that shows creativity and intelligence and has a calming effect on the psyche.

The **Noctis Lux** light theme's background is a very saturated very light warm orange.<br>Orange can increase oxygen supply to the brain to produce an invigorating effect.

## **The Font** used in the screenshots

The font in the screenshots are actually 2 fonts glued together with [Custom CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css). For normal style I used [Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig) and for italics [Cartograph Mono CF](http://connary.com/cartograph.html).
I think there is a beautiful synergy between the two fonts and they intertwine naturally together.

### "How did you do it?" [#2](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis/issues/2)

The walkthrough is for Windows. I assume that for Unix and MacOS you would have to change only the path.

1. IMPORTANT: _Run as aministrator_ VS Code
2. install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)
3. download or copy the content of [customvscode.css](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis/blob/master/vscodecustom.css)
4. copy `customvscode.css` in `C:\Users\your-own-username`. As an example this is what I have on my system: `C:\Users\liviuschera\customvscode.css`
5. in `settings.json` add:
   ```json
     "editor.fontFamily": "Hasklig",
     "vscode_custom_css.imports":
       [
         "file://C:/Users/yourusername/vscodecustom.css"
       ],
   ```
6. press `F1`
7. select `Enable Custom CSS and JS`
8. reload VS Code (it doesn't have to be in administrator mode)

> NOTES:
>
> -  if VS Code complains about that it is corrupted, simply click “Don't show again”.
> -  every time after VS Code is updated or you change the configuration, please re-enable Custom CSS
> -  make sure that you comment out the optional CSS code if you don't want to change the UI's default font.

## Syntax colors

The color names were matched to one of the following main color hues: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Brown and Grey using the excelent online tools [Color Name & Hue](http://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/) and [Name that Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color).
